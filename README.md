## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

<h2>üî• Testronix Reserve Backend Using Laravel üî• </h2>
<p>How to use?</p>
<ul>
  <li>You just need to download the zip and extract it. After that download composer and install it for the dependencies.</p>
</li>
  <li>Next, download xampp apache server so that the server will run</li>
  <li>The route here is in API file and on laravel 11 there's no api file. To see the file just open terminal and run "<strong>php artisan install:api</strong>"</li>
  <li>And for the middleware i used JWT no need to setup the JWT, its already setup.</li>
  <li>Let's move now on setting up the database. On your xampp just open the phpmyadmin and create table.</li>
  <li>Once you have the table just check the .env file in the code and look for the database name. Make sure the table you created is the same on .env</li>
 <li>We are in final stage just run on the terminal <strong>php artisan migrate:fresh --seed</strong> this command will migrate the table you created. You have now the database.</li>
  <li>I suggest to use postman for API testing but before you test the backend you just need to run the server. Run the apache and in terminal just type <strong>php artisan serve</strong> </li>
    <li>After running that get the url something like http://127.0.0.1:8000 this url is the API. just paste this url in postman and test it.</li>
</ul>
