<h2>üî• Testronix Reserve Backend Using Laravel üî• </h2>
  <img src="/public/visual-work.jpg" alt="visual work">
<p>How to use?</p>
<ul>
  <li>You just need to download the zip and extract it. After that download composer and install it for the dependencies.</p>
</li>
  <li>Next, download xampp apache server so that the server will run</li>
  <li>The route here is in API file and on laravel 11 there's no api file. To see the file just open terminal and run "<strong>php artisan install:api</strong>"</li>
  <li>And for the middleware i used JWT no need to setup the JWT, its already setup.</li>
  <li>Let's move now on setting up the database. On your xampp just open the phpmyadmin and create table.</li>
  <li>Once you have the table just check the .env file in the code and look for the database name. Make sure the table you created is the same on .env</li>
 <li>We are in final stage just run on the terminal <strong>php artisan migrate:fresh --seed</strong> this command will migrate the table you created. You have now the database.</li>
  <li>I suggest to use postman for API testing but before you test the backend you just need to run the server. Run the apache and in terminal just type <strong>php artisan serve</strong> </li>
    <li>After running that get the url something like http://127.0.0.1:8000 this url is the API. just paste this url in postman and test it.</li>
</ul>
